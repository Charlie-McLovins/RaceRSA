# RaceRSA
A very stupid (not cryptographically secure) implementation of RSA in Rust using the RaceNG crate by DvorakDwarf (https://github.com/dvorakdwarf/raceng). It is insecure, slow, and prone to causing my computer to hard crash when I run it. But it does technically function as a horrible RSA implementation.
